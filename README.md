## **About**
    We are a project group apart in the KU Chapter of IEEE. Our project focuses on tracking the movement of cars in parking garages at KU to count the number of parking spots available on each level. We accomplish this by using ultrasonic sensors and ESP8266 boards to record the data and a raspberry pi to send data to the web server. Our website displays the number of total parking spots on each level using counters and a dynamic chart. We decided to start this project because it is difficult to find parking on campus as many people will either come to campus early to get themselves a spot or drive around to multiple lots just to find parking. This application would allow people to look ahead of time and know where the open spaces are rather than take a gamble everytime. Right now this application would only be used in one parking garage but we would wish to expand to all parking garages and lots if we could.
